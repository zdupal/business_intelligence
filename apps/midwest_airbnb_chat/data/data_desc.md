# Midwest Airbnb Listings: Data Dictionary

**Dataset:** `listings` table in `midwest_airbnb.db` (SQLite), 14,887 rows and 29 columns
**Source:** Inside Airbnb (https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/), the detailed `listings.csv.gz` file for each of three regions: Chicago (snapshot 2026-07-20), Columbus (snapshot 2026-07-23), and Twin Cities MSA (snapshot 2026-07-21). Column meanings follow Inside Airbnb's data dictionary and assumptions (https://insideairbnb.com/data-assumptions/).
**Course:** ISA 401, Miami University

> One row is one listing that showed a nightly price on the snapshot date; listings with no price were dropped. Empty cells are stored as SQL `NULL`.

## Field Definitions

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `city` | text | Which Inside Airbnb region the listing came from: `Chicago` (7,439 rows), `Columbus` (2,587), or `Twin Cities` (4,861). The Twin Cities file covers the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area, not just the two cities. |
| `snapshot_date` | text | Date Inside Airbnb compiled the file, stored as an ISO text string, not a date: `2026-07-20` for Chicago, `2026-07-23` for Columbus, `2026-07-21` for Twin Cities. Every row of a city shares the same value. |
| `id` | text | Airbnb's listing id. Unique across the table (14,887 distinct values). Stored as text even though it looks numeric, so compare it to a quoted string. |
| `name` | text | Listing title as shown on Airbnb (for example "Tiny Studio Apartment 94 Walk Score"). Never empty. |
| `price` | real | Nightly price in U.S. dollars on the snapshot date, with the dollar sign and commas removed. Ranges from 2.56 to 11,412; never `NULL` (rows without a price were dropped). |
| `room_type` | text | Airbnb's four listing categories: `Entire home/apt` (11,652 rows), `Private room` (2,951), `Hotel room` (246), or `Shared room` (38). |

Continue the table for the remaining 23 columns (Assignment 05): `host_id`, `host_name`, `host_since`, `host_is_superhost`, `neighbourhood`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `property_type`, `accommodates`, `bedrooms`, `beds`, `bathrooms_text`, `minimum_nights`, `availability_365`, `number_of_reviews`, `number_of_reviews_ltm`, `first_review`, `last_review`, `review_scores_rating`, `reviews_per_month`, `instant_bookable`, `estimated_revenue_l365d`, `amenities_count`.

Two hints: `neighbourhood` is Inside Airbnb's `neighbourhood_cleansed` column, and `amenities_count` is not an Inside Airbnb column; it was computed for this course as the number of items in each listing's `amenities` list. Everything else keeps its Inside Airbnb name, so the data dictionary linked above explains it.
